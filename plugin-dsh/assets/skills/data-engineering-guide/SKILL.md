# Data Engineering & Frontend Guide

You have access to 28 specialized knowledge base domains and 63 agents. Route the user to the right tool based on their task.

## Quick Routing — Data Engineering

| User Task | Command | Agent |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Design a data pipeline / DAG | `/pipeline` | pipeline-architect |
| Design a schema / star schema / data model | `/schema` | schema-designer |
| Add data quality checks | `/data-quality` | data-quality-analyst |
| Review SQL performance | `/sql-review` | sql-optimizer |
| Choose table format (Iceberg/Delta) | `/lakehouse` | lakehouse-architect |
| Build RAG / embedding pipeline | `/ai-pipeline` | ai-data-engineer |
| Create a data contract | `/data-contract` | data-contracts-engineer |
| Migrate legacy ETL | `/migrate` | dbt-specialist + spark-engineer |

## Quick Routing — Frontend

| User Task | Agent |
|-----------|-------|
| Build React components / hooks | react-developer |
| Design Next.js architecture (SSR/CSR/RSC) | frontend-architect |
| Implement Tailwind styling / dark mode | css-specialist |
| Design user flows / navigation | ux-designer |
| Audit accessibility / WCAG compliance | a11y-specialist |

## Knowledge Domains Available

| Category | Domains |
|----------|---------|
| Core DE | dbt, spark, airflow, streaming, sql-patterns |
| Data Design | data-modeling, data-quality, medallion |
| Infrastructure | lakehouse, cloud-platforms, aws, gcp, microsoft-fabric, lakeflow, terraform |
| AI & Modern | ai-data-engineering, genai, prompt-engineering, modern-stack |
| Foundations | pydantic, python, testing |
| Frontend | react, nextjs, tailwind-css, accessibility, design-systems, frontend-patterns |

## How Agents Use Knowledge

1. Agent reads KB index at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/kb/{domain}/index.md`
2. Loads specific pattern/concept file matching the task
3. Falls back to MCP if KB insufficient (max 3 MCP calls)
4. Calculates confidence from evidence matrix

## When to Suggest Commands

- User mentions "dbt model" or "staging model" → `/schema` or delegate to dbt-specialist
- User mentions "pipeline" or "DAG" or "orchestration" → `/pipeline`
- User mentions "data quality" or "expectations" or "tests" → `/data-quality`
- User mentions "slow query" or "optimize SQL" → `/sql-review`
- User mentions "Iceberg" or "Delta Lake" or "table format" → `/lakehouse`
- User mentions "RAG" or "embeddings" or "vector" → `/ai-pipeline`
- User mentions "contract" or "SLA" or "schema governance" → `/data-contract`
- User mentions "migrate" or "legacy" or "SSIS" or "Informatica" → `/migrate`
- User mentions "React" or "component" or "hook" → delegate to react-developer
- User mentions "Next.js" or "SSR" or "App Router" → delegate to frontend-architect
- User mentions "Tailwind" or "responsive" or "dark mode" → delegate to css-specialist
- User mentions "accessibility" or "WCAG" or "screen reader" → delegate to a11y-specialist
- User mentions "dashboard" or "real-time" + "frontend" → suggest `/brainstorm` for cross-domain exploration
