1. **Do NOT open a public issue**
2. Email the maintainers directly or use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/luanmorenommaciel/agentspec/security/advisories/new)
3. Include steps to reproduce, impact assessment, and suggested fix if possible

## Security Considerations for AgentSpec Users

AgentSpec generates and executes code through Claude Code. Keep these practices in mind:

1. **Review agent outputs** before executing generated code in production
2. **Do not store secrets** in KB domains, examples, or SDD documents
3. **Validate external data** referenced in custom agents or KB patterns
4. **Use `.gitignore`** to exclude sensitive files from SDD feature documents
5. **Review PR diffs** carefully when using `/create-pr` — ensure no credentials are staged

## Scope

This security policy covers the AgentSpec framework itself (agents, commands, templates, KB scaffolding). It does not cover:

- Code generated by agents during `/build` (your responsibility to review)
- Third-party KB domain content
- Claude Code or Anthropic API security (report to [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/security))
