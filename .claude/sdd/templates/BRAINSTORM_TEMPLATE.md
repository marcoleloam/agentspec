## Discovery Questions & Answers

| # | Question | Answer | Impact |
|---|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | {Question about purpose} | {User's answer} | {How this shapes the solution} |
| 2 | {Question about users} | {User's answer} | {How this shapes the solution} |
| 3 | {Question about constraints} | {User's answer} | {How this shapes the solution} |
| 4 | {Question about success criteria} | {User's answer} | {How this shapes the solution} |

**Minimum Questions:** 3 (to ensure clarity before proceeding)

## Sample Data Inventory

> Samples improve LLM accuracy through in-context learning and few-shot prompting.

| Type | Location | Count | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Input files | {Path or N/A} | {N} | {Format, size, patterns} |
| Output examples | {Path or N/A} | {N} | {Schema, structure} |
| Ground truth | {Path or N/A} | {N} | {Verified correct values} |
| Related code | {Path or N/A} | {N} | {Patterns to reuse} |

**How samples will be used:**

- {e.g., Few-shot examples in extraction prompts}
- {e.g., Schema validation reference}
- {e.g., Test fixtures for validation}
